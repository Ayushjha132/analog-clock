Goal: 
    create a analog clock purely in html, css, js.


calcuate clock rotations 

hour: 
    12 hours = 360 degree
    1 hour = 360/12 = 30 degree

    so for h hours
    h = 30h

    but on hour rotation there is the impact of mins and second's key impact is negilible because of too small. 

    1 hour = 60 mins
    60 mins = 30 degree
    1 min = 30/60 = 1/2 degree
    so for m mins
    m = m/2 degree

    thus the total rotation will be 
    = 30h + m/2 degrees


min: 
    60min = 360 degree
    1 min = 360/60
    m = 6m degree

sec: 
    60 sec = 360 degree
    1 sec = 360/60
    s = 6s degree
